# Docs

docs are built using [novella](https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/novella)
which uses mkdocs internally.

## Building

first install requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

then build the docs

```bash
novella
```

this will create a directory `/docs/_site` with the built docs.
